In per gene plot the 'pair' of the condition that is compared to is coloured white, conditions not compared are coloured grey
Changed in other comparison selectors so now gives you options rather then having to type them
Uses local backup of 'translation table' to fall back when offline

#Bug fixes
Position of FPKM number in Per Gene tab graph fixed for genes with big FPKM differences
On Per Gene plot names of bars rotated 45 degrees to ensure that all are shown on low resolution screens

Can now click on a gene in Table tab or Filter file genes tab and goes to Per Gene tab and selects that gene
Per gene tab gene entry box now has autocomplete
Per gene tab gene_names_table now only shows third row if has data for it
Human added as option - uses offline translation as Humanmine is not remotely complete for Ensembl gene lookups
Added ability to choose + define data format
Added a popup to say that you can only have removal buttons for n annotations (currently 10)

#Bug fixes
Fixed bug where filtering out all genes gave error
Changed numeric table columns so it knows they are numbers and does numeric sort
