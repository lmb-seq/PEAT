"2814"	"WBGene00003004"	"lin-15 is a complex locus containing two non-overlapping transcripts, lin-15A and lin-15B, separated by less than 150 bp and transcribed in the same direction. LIN-15A and B proteins are novel and have a THAP zinc-finger-like (C2CH) motif. The lin-15A transcript is processed with the addition of an SL1 or and SL2 trans-splice leader. lin-15B has only been shown to have an SL1 added. These features suggest the lin-15 locus encodes a single polycistronic mRNA. Alleles of lin-15 were first obtained based on the Multivulva (Muv) phenotype. More alleles were identified in screens for vulval cell lineage mutants, where all six vulval precursor cells (VPCs) adopt vulval fates, causing the Muv phenotype. Initial studies of these alleles showed lin-15 to have two independently mutable activities, A and B; A and B class Muv genes were defined by synthetic genetic interactions with lin-8 and lin-9, respectively. Homozygous class A or B mutants do not exhibit any vulval phenotypes whereas A+B double homozygotes are Syn-Muv. While some lin-15 alleles fall into either the A OR B classes, for example, n767 and n744 respectively, most of the alleles are Muv as homozygotes alone and hence are AB mutants, for example, n765. Molecular analysis showed that the lin-15 locus comprised two independent transcripts with the downstream transcript encoding lin-15A function and the upstream transcript encoding lin-15B function. A and B mutant alleles alter the downstream and upstream functions, respectively, and AB alleles affect both transcripts. Further, all single homozyogus Muv alleles proved to be rearrangements or deletions in the lin-15 locus. Although A and B functions are genetically redundant, A function can not rescue B function and thus A and B are not molecularly redundant. Fragments of the lin-15 locus that rescue either lin-15A or lin-15B are common and useful coinjection transgenic markers when using a lin-15(n765tsAB) mutant background."

"4880"	"WBGene00005153"	"srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter (NST) most similar to the subfamily of UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine transporters; SRF-3 can function as a nucleotide sugar transporter in heterologous in vitro and in vivo systems using UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrates; mutations in srf-3 alter the surface antigenicity of the cuticle in C. elegans; srf-3 mutations show altered binding to antibodies raised against the cuticles of wild-type worms, and lectins like wheat germ agglutinin; srf-3 mutants are resistant to infection by the nematode-specific pathogen, Microbacterium nematophilum, and to the adherence of bacteria like Yersinia pseudotuberculosis which form biofilms; this resistance is most likely due to an altered glycoconjugate surface composition; srf-3 mutants also show an altered response in the form of increased susceptibility to nematophagous fungi; srf-3 mutants seem to have fragile cuticles compared to wild-type; srf-3 is expressed in seam cells, glandular cells g1/g2 and the spermatheca."
"4881"	"WBGene00005154"	"srf-4 was identified as a mutation that alters the surface antigenicity of the cuticle in C. elegans; srf-4 mutations show altered binding to antibodies raised against the cuticles of wild-type worms, and lectins like wheat germ agglutinin; the altered binding maybe the result of an expression of a new antigen that is likely hidden in wild type and thus cryptic to surface reactive reagents; in addition to change in cuticle reactivity, srf-4 mutants also show uncoordinated movement, abnormal gonadal and male tail morphologies, and male infertility."

"4883"	"WBGene00005156"	"srf-6 was identified in surface immunofluorescence screens for mutants that show constitutive larval display (CLD) of the L1 epitope on all four larval stages; normally wild-type worms can be induced to display a first larval stage (L1) epitope in response to environmental signals, known as the inducible larval display (ILD); srf-6 is required for chemotaxis, similar to the genes osm-3 (a cytoplasmic kinesin), che-3 (a cyotosolic dynein heavy chain), and tax-4 (a cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channel subunit), whose mutants show reduced ILD and block the CLD of srf-6; srf-6 interacts with the genes in the TGF-beta like pathway like daf-14 to enhance the dauer-constitutive phenotype; srf-6 mutants are also resistant to the attachment of Yersinia biofilms; thus srf-6 may play a regulatory role in the overlapping functions of chemotaxis, dauer formation and surface determination."
